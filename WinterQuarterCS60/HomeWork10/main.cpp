// Driver program for CSCI 60 Homework 10; due Thursday 3/16/23
//
// The littleDriverProgram tests the Parity iterator you designed for HW10.
// Note that the class allows clients to insert 0, but this program doesn't
// because 0 is used as a sentinal value. Also note that the program assumes
// the user doesn't enter any non-ints and will throw an uncaught exception if
// the user provides the wrong input. (Test programs don't have to be robust!)
//
// Do not upload this file; do use it in any way helpful to you!
