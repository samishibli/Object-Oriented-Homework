// Driver program for CSCI 60 Homework 9; due Tuesday 3/12/23
//
// The littleDriverProgram partially tests the Parity member functions.
// Note that the class allows clients to insert 0, but this program doesn't
// because 0 is used as a sentinal value. Also note that the program assumes
// the user doesn't enter any non-ints and will throw an uncaught exception if
// the user provides the wrong input. (Test programs don't have to be robust!)
// You don't have to turn this file in, so use it in any way helpful to you!
